- #### We have created an entire CI pipeline which includes all the stages including Code Analysis, Style checkers, Code Coverage, Code Assemble and Docker Image Build, readily available to run the image on any server without manually setting up the environment.

### Third-Party Tools

- [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

  SQLite is often used with Flask due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and compatibility with Flask applications. Here's why it's commonly used:

  **Easy Setup**: SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration database engine. It doesn't require a separate server process to be running. For small to medium-sized applications, this ease of setup and use can be beneficial.

  **No Configuration**: As SQLite doesn't require configuration or maintenance of a separate server, it's convenient for development environments and smaller-scale applications. In Flask, SQLite can be used with minimal setup.

  **Portability**: SQLite databases are stored as a single file. This makes them highly portable and easy to transfer or share among different environments or applications.

  **Suitability for Prototyping and Small Projects**: For early stages of development, when the emphasis might be on rapidly prototyping an application or for smaller projects with relatively lower data requirements, SQLite can be a good choice due to its simplicity.

  **Flask Integration**: Flask has built-in support for SQLite. The sqlite3 module is included in Python's standard library, allowing Flask applications to interact with SQLite databases seamlessly.

- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)
- [Adzuna](https://developer.adzuna.com/overview)
  
  The API provides access to rich job market data, including job descriptions, salaries, locations, and other relevant details. This data can be integrated into applications or platforms to offer insights into the job market trends and opportunities.

## Getting Started & Installation:

- ### Prerequisite:

  - Download [Python3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- ### Installation:

  E.g If you downloaded `Python 3.8.7` above, then

  **Steps to setup virtual environment**

  - Create a virtual environment:

    `python3.8 -m venv test_env`

  - Activate the virtual environment:

    `source test_env/bin/activate`

  - Build the virtual environment:(must be present in [project root directory](https://github.com/se2024-jpg/WolfTrack6.0))

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- ### Run Instructions

  **To run/test the site locally:**

  - Clone [WolfTrack github repo](https://github.com/se2024-jpg/WolfTrack6.0).

  - Navigate to [project directory](https://github.com/se2024-jpg/WolfTrack6.0).

  - Run `python app.py` or `python3 app.py` <br> <br>
    If there is a certificate error coming up for nltk stopwords download: <br>

    - search for "Install Certificates.command" in finder and open it. Its a script that will install required Certificates. <br>
    - Run the above command again.

  - Site will be hosted at:
    `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

- ### API Setup
**Create an Account:**

  Go to the Adzuna Developer portal developer.adzuna.com.
  Sign up for an account to access the API. You might need to provide some basic details about your application, such as the name, purpose, and contact information.

**Get API Credentials:**

  Log in to your Adzuna Developer account.
  Find the section to create an API application.
  Create a new application to generate API credentials (usually API keys or tokens). These credentials are necessary to authenticate your requests to the Adzuna API.

**Change URL:**

  Update the adzuna_url in your app.py - using the newly obtained credentials. This updated URL should reflect the API endpoint along with your authentication credentials for accessing the Adzuna API.
