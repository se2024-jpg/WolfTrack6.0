### Third-Party Tools

- [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

  SQLite is often used with Flask due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and compatibility with Flask applications. Here's why it's commonly used:

  **Easy Setup**: SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration database engine. It doesn't require a separate server process to be running. For small to medium-sized applications, this ease of setup and use can be beneficial.

  **No Configuration**: As SQLite doesn't require configuration or maintenance of a separate server, it's convenient for development environments and smaller-scale applications. In Flask, SQLite can be used with minimal setup.

  **Portability**: SQLite databases are stored as a single file. This makes them highly portable and easy to transfer or share among different environments or applications.

  **Suitability for Prototyping and Small Projects**: For early stages of development, when the emphasis might be on rapidly prototyping an application or for smaller projects with relatively lower data requirements, SQLite can be a good choice due to its simplicity.

  **Flask Integration**: Flask has built-in support for SQLite. The sqlite3 module is included in Python's standard library, allowing Flask applications to interact with SQLite databases seamlessly.
  
- [Adzuna](https://developer.adzuna.com/overview)
  
  The API provides access to rich job market data, including job descriptions, salaries, locations, and other relevant details. This data can be integrated into applications or platforms to offer insights into the job market trends and opportunities.

  - Download [Python3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- ### Installation:

  E.g If you downloaded `Python 3.10.12` above, then

  **Steps to setup virtual environment**

  - Create a virtual environment:

    `python3.10 -m venv test_env`

  - Activate the virtual environment:

    `source test_env/bin/activate`

  - Build the virtual environment:(must be present in [project root directory](https://github.com/se2024-jpg/WolfTrack6.0))

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- ### Run Instructions

  **To run/test the site locally:**

  - Clone [WolfTrack github repo](https://github.com/se2024-jpg/WolfTrack6.0).

  - Navigate to [project directory](https://github.com/se2024-jpg/WolfTrack6.0).

  - Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` <br> <br>
    If there is a certificate error coming up for nltk stopwords download: <br>
